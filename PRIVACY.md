[T√ºrk√ße versiyonu i√ßin tƒ±klayƒ±n / Click here for Turkish version](./PRIVACY_TR.md)

## Overview
Ahtapot Security Extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension analyzes cybersecurity indicators (IOCs) using third-party security APIs to help security professionals assess potential threats.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Store Locally
All data is stored **exclusively on your local device** using Chrome's secure storage API. We do not have any servers, and no data is transmitted to us.

1. **API Keys**
   - Your API keys for security services (VirusTotal, Shodan, AbuseIPDB, URLScan.io, Have I Been Pwned)
   - Stored securely in Chrome's local storage
   - Never transmitted to our servers (we don't have any)
   - Only used to authenticate with respective security services

2. **Cached Analysis Results**
   - Previously analyzed IOCs (IP addresses, domains, URLs, file hashes, email addresses)
   - Cached to avoid redundant API calls and respect rate limits
   - Automatically deleted based on user-configured retention period
   - Improves performance and reduces API usage

3. **User Preferences**
   - Language preference (English/Turkish)
   - Cache retention period (user-configurable)
   - Extension settings and configurations

### Cache Retention and Management
- **User Control**: You configure how long cached IOC results are retained
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Data older than the configured threshold is automatically deleted
- **Default Period**: 7 days (adjustable by user)
- **Manual Clearing**: You can clear the cache manually at any time from settings
- **Configurable Threshold**: Set retention period from 1 to 30 days

## Data We Do NOT Collect

We want to be crystal clear about what we **DO NOT** do:

- ‚ùå We do NOT collect any personal information
- ‚ùå We do NOT track your browsing history beyond selected text analysis
- ‚ùå We do NOT transmit any data to our servers (we don't operate any servers)
- ‚ùå We do NOT sell or share your data with anyone
- ‚ùå We do NOT use analytics or tracking services
- ‚ùå We do NOT display advertisements
- ‚ùå We do NOT monitor your activity

## How the Extension Works

1. **User-Initiated Analysis**: You select text or right-click on a webpage
2. **Local Processing**: The extension extracts IOCs (IP addresses, domains, etc.) locally
3. **API Requests**: Using YOUR API keys, requests are sent directly to security services
4. **Results Display**: Analysis results are displayed in the side panel
5. **Optional Caching**: Results are cached locally if you enable this feature

## Third-Party Security Services

When you analyze IOCs, the extension sends requests **directly** to third-party security APIs using your API keys. We act as a client only:

### Services Supported
- **VirusTotal** - File, URL, and IP address analysis
- **Shodan** - IP address and network device analysis
- **AbuseIPDB** - IP address abuse detection
- **URLScan.io** - URL and website analysis
